# Introduction & Overview

My overarching research project is a cultural history of the gadget, as both a functional tool and a fictional device.

Say something about "interaction," how it mediates between technology and technique, the hard material of the machine and cultural imaginaries.

One of the historically specific contexts that I explore this nexus of technology and fictional thought is in the origins of American science fiction in electrical experimenter catalogs, a context no one has really looked at.

# Mumford

One example I usually like to begin with in discussing this material is this article...

...perhaps one of the most interesting specimens in the history of pocket wireless.

It's not the most technically original, nor is it the most imaginative in terms of the communicative scenario it projects.  However, both its designer and the circumstances of its appearance in the April 1911 issue of Hugo Gernsback's *Modern Electrics* magazine merit our attention.  In the magazine's monthly "Experimental Department," where readers could submit their home-brewed designs for novel electric devices, Lewis Mumford -- author of the now-famous history of media titled *Technics and Civilization* (1934) -- published his first piece of writing at the age of 15:  a blueprint for a new kind of compact wireless receiver.  Flipping back three pages in the same issue, one can find the first installment of Gernsback's serial novel *Ralph 124C 41+:  A Romance of the Year 2660*, one of the earliest works of modern science fiction.

The proximity of this future media theorist's first piece of published writing to one of the foundational works of science fiction is no coincidence.  Lewis Mumford's early preoccupation as a tinkerer took root in a forum for the exchange of designs, components, and visions of the future.  Mumford, who would go on to have a successful career as a literary critic and associate editor of *The Dial*, cites these experiences among a community of tinkerers in the pages of *Modern Electrics* as foundational for his later theories of what he called technology's "spiritual contribution to our culture."

*Modern Electrics*, which began as a mail-order catalogue for exotic, imported wireless parts, gradually evolved into "A magazine devoted entirely to the Electrical Arts."  The magazine profiled international developments in new media technologies, summarized the latest U.S. Patents awarded to electrical experimenters, and solicited amateur blueprints, designs, and techniques from readers.  What sets *Modern Electrics* apart from other technical publications of the period like *The Wireless Age* and *QST* is the way in which its writers enlisted fiction in their attempts to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media such as radio, television, or the more exotic osophon and telegraphone.  

For instance, when readers submitting a design encountered difficulties in describing its specifications -- perhaps a certain component was technically or economically unfeasible -- they would stitch their incomplete engineering diagrams together with narrative threads.  In a tradition that continued throughout Gernsback's later publications -- including *Electrical Experimenter, Radio News, Science and Invention,* and most famously, *Amazing Stories* (the first ever science fiction magazine) -- *Modern Electrics* pioneered a kind of writing that combined hard technical description with an openness to the fantastic.  It was a mixture out of which an entire literary genre emerged to tackle the question of the distinctive specificity of "medium" in a new wireless age.

Today, the phrase "science fiction" conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, starships, and sonic screwdrivers.  But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before a century's accretion of images, narratives, and cliches, that which was not yet called science fiction consisted of a great number of concrete practices all geared toward a reckoning with the technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life.  "Science," wrote Gernsback in the inaugural issue of *Amazing Stories*,

> through its various branches of mechanics, astronomy, etc., enters so intimately into all our lives today, and we are so much immersed in this science, that we have become rather prone to take new inventions and discoveries for granted.  Our entire mode of living has been changed with the present progress, and it is little wonder, therefore, that many fantastic situations ... are brought about today.  It is in these situations that the new romancers find their great inspiration. ^[@gernsback1927]

For Gernsback, "science" is synonymous with "applied science," an amalgam of science and technology that saw no division between the explanation of complex things and the often fantastic incursion of those things into modern life.  The paradox at the heart of Gernsback's project is that science, that supposed vehicle of enlightenment rationality, can *itself* produce enchantment and wonder.

This is not a perspective unique to Gernsback's emphasis on the *applied* sciences.  As Philip Fisher reminds us, it is often the very act of scientifc explanation that renders the object or phenomenon in question marvelously strange: "every stage of explanation . . . has consistently dispelled the extraordinary only to produce, in the very act of explanation, newer forms of wonder."

Our literary historical challenge in working with this material, then, is to recover the sense of radical openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of "scientifiction" stories (as they called it then) who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that . . . 

>Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible.
-Gernsback, "A New Sort of Magazine

Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.

In this talk, I will examine the circumstances of science fiction's invention in America.  In contrast to the deeper history of utopias and political satires in the European tradition that would be drawn upon in the twentieth century by H.G. Wells, Olaf Stapledon, Aldous Huxley, and J.G. Ballard, I will argue that science fiction emerged in America as a discourse on media.  While some of the most influential histories of science fiction have subsumed the genre within a larger continuum of utopian literature (as does Frederic Jameson with his emphasis on the transihistorical "desire called utopia"), this approach ends up emphasizing the vast worldbuilding enterprises of the American left (as in Ignatius Donnelly's *Caesar's Column* from 1890 and Edward Bellamy's 1888 record best seller *Looking Backward*), while papering over the smaller-scale, everyday concerns of the technologists and technocrats on the other side of the Atlantic (most notably, Rudyard Kipling).

It also overlooks many of the speculative energies that were both inspired by and reflected in literary productions: cinema, tinkering, popular science, exhibitions, and industrial design.  Setting aside the literary historical syntheses of those science fiction critics looking to elevate the status of the genre by associating it with utopias and political satires, my concerns are quite different.

I'll proceed instead through a speculative question of my own:  what would a literary history constructed from objects look like?  Because the history I have in mind here is not one of *literature* as a body of works but the far more slippery *fiction* as a relation to reality, or what has been called "a form of lived experience," this is not entirely a question of book history, with its emphasis on the material practices and circulation of literature.  In fact, perhaps a shift in emphasis is necessary, from the question of literary history to one of *fictional history.*  In revisiting the genealogy of what Gernsback first christened as "scientifiction," I want to get at the production of those particularly otherworldly moments of everyday life, those moments that seem to extract us from the flow of the ordinary and provide us with a new persepctive on it.

For Michael Wood, fiction can be seen as

> something we find in the slightest hints and verbal gestures of ordinary life, whenever we speak playfully or ironically, or call something by a name that is not its own; whenever we see or say that people and places have markedly changed while stubbornly, loyally remaining the same.

While book history takes up the materiality of literature, the materiality of fiction presents us with some potentially thornier questions.  How are ficitons expressed not only in literary form, but in organizations, plans, engineering diagrams, standards, and physical media machines?  How might we conceptualize or model this moment of exchange between the material and the possible?  Science fiction, a literary genre that emerged out of an electrical parts catalog, provides one starting point for such questions.

I'll proceed by providing, first, a crash course in science fiction studies, for those of you who haven't been lifelong fans, as I have -- what's important for our purposes is to look at some attempts that have been made in the field to account for the genre outside of its textual productions.  Second, we'll move into the specific context of the early 20th century electrical experimenter magazines and their significance as media historical documents.  And finally, I'll say a bit about…

# Everyday Estrangement

One would be hard pressed to find a formulation in the lexicon of literary criticism that has stood unchallenged longer than Darko Suvin’s definition of science fiction (SF) as the literature of “cognitive estrangement.”  Other useful definitions have certainly emerged from the genre’s authors and critics, but few have proven as rigorous and influential as Suvin’s, and it has held sway over the study of the genre for four decades.

First put forward in “On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre” (1972), the phrase “cognitive estrangement” defined the “necessary and sufficient conditions” of a genre

> whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment. \[full quote on slide]\

According to this model, science fiction is premised on a process of “estrangement” in that the literary gambit of the individual work consists of a “what if” question directed away from whatever we accept to be this world.  Importantly, this movement away from our world must be “cognitive.”  That is, the fictional hypothesis of the work is elaborated with objective, “scientific” rigor—it has to be plausible.

Pretty basic, formalist stuff, but it’s only now that attacks on this formulation of science fiction’s supposedly defining feature are gaining any traction.  Samuel R. Delany, who questions whether nailing down a concrete definition of science fiction is at all a useful critical endeavor in the first place, was one early detractor of Suvin’s work.  Delany argues that

> the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition in a literary work are simply and blatantly insufficient to produce SF.  If they interact in one way, they produce fantasy.  If they interact in another, they produce surrealism.  If they interact in still another, they produce criticism.

Contemporary science fiction author China Miéville takes a more pointed approach in his contribution to a recent volume on Marxism in science fiction, drawing attention to the way that cognition in Suvin’s account is premised on an uncritical and monolithic ideal of science.  Miéville writes,

> To the extent that SF claims to be based on ‘science,’ and indeed on what is deemed ‘rationality,’ it is based on capitalist modernity’s ideologically projected self-justification: not some abstract/ideal ‘science,’ but capitalist science’s bullshit about itself.

Suvin's notion of scientific "cognition" thus ignores not only the social construction of what counts as scientific fact, but also the works inspired by the New Wave of 1960s science fiction whose extrapolations proceed not from “science” but conceptions of gender, race, class, psychology, and sexuality.

For other critics, the fact that Suvin focuses only on literary works of science fiction (a model which, furthermore, Suvin himself admits excludes 95% of what is published *as* science fiction) is enough to render his model useless, as it ignores the output of the genre in film, television, comics, performance and visual art, and even some types of critical theory.  Istvan Csicsery-Ronay takes a more catholic approach in his book *The Seven Beauties of Science Fiction* (2008), a catalog of the formal markers native to the genre.  Surveying the many varieties of aesthetic experience science fiction can take up in all of its various media, Csicsery-Ronay even allows for the possibility that science fiction might be seen as a certain modality of lived experience in what he calls our thoroughly “technologized world.”

> The widespread normalization of what is essentially a style of estrangement and dislocation has stimulated the development of science-fictional habits of mind, so that we no longer treat SF as purely a genre-engine producing formulaic effects, but rather as a kind of awareness we might call science-fictionality, a mode of response that frames and tests experiences as if they were aspects of a work of science fiction. . . .  Most people merely bracket difficult-to-process, incongruous moments of technology’s intersection with everyday life as science-fictional moments.

This affective turn toward “science fictionality,” an expansion of the poetics of a literary genre into a category of experience, constitutes one of the more interesting developments in science fiction studies over the past decade or so.  In its simplest formulation, the idea circulates as a truism that “the world finally has caught up with science fiction.”  Many instances of this saying attempt to highlight the way in which the rate of technological change feels like it outpaces any attempt to understand the significance of that incursion in our daily lives.  Others try to come to terms with the fact that many of the genre’s imagined futures never came to pass, as in the popularity of retrofuturist books like *Where’s My Jetpack?* and blogs like Paleofuture, both of which explore how images of futures past sync up with the present in uncanny ways.

Some scholars in science fiction studies encouraged a shift in the field's focus toward the science fictionality of everyday life in order to account for a media historically specific shift.  Brooks Landon, for instance, writes of his

> belief that contemporary electronic technology has so displaced the savor of potentiality from stories about ‘great vistas in time and space’ to ways in which we actually experience time and space anew, that our culture now unconsciously brings to the experience of film and electronic media expectations very similar to those of the traditional SF reader.

For yet another camp of science fiction critics, the experience of science fictionality itself is the product of a postmodern accretion of text upon text to the point that “the literature of the future has a long and honored past,” as Bruce Sterling writes in the preface to his famous anthology of 1980s cyberpunk fiction, *Mirrorshades*: 

> The cyberpunks are perhaps the first SF generation to grow up not only within the literary tradition of science fiction but in a truly science-fictional world.

While critical discussions on science fictionality were launched in order to describe certain contours of the contemporary moment, the sense that the world has caught up with its own fantastic dreams is not a recent development, and eslewhere in my project I write on precisely this problem of how the present both comes to terms with and avoids identifying itself as the present that past ages had imagined.  Many film and media scholars have remarked for some time on the inherent science fictionality of media technologies and their realignment of our sense of time and space, cinema foremost among them.^[Michelson, Annette, “Bodies in Space: Film as ‘Carnal Knowledge,’” *Artforum* Vol. 7 No. 6 (1969), pp. 54-63. Michelson, Annette, “On the Eve of the Future: The Reasonable Facsimile and the Philosophical Toy,” *October* vol. 29 (Summer, 1984). Bukatman, Scott, “Who Programs You? The Science Fiction of the Spectacle,” in *Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema,* ed. Annette Kuhn (London: Verso, 1990), pp. 196-213. Bukatman, Scott, “There’s Always Tommorowland: Disney and the Hypercinematic Experience,” *October* 57 (Summer 1991), pp. 55-78.]

The question I'm interested in is what type of literary, or rather “fictional” history would result if this approach to science fiction as a particular form of everyday experience was projected back into a reevaluation of the genre as a whole, rather than confined to a particular historical moment within it.  Instead of understanding “science fictionality” as the product of a postmodern accretion of images and narratives, how might we instead revise our understanding of science fiction’s literary history so that it might be seen as a structural inheritance of the genre’s very origins?  
   
    [TABLE THIS -- find a new pivot point with these cinema and SF articles, as a way of talking about the production and representation of "the new" as a topic in media history.  gets us into "what's new about new media" territory.  gesture towards this quicly and move on]

It is precisely this production of the strange and wondrous new—which as Wendy Chun reminds us, is itself “a historical category linked to the rise of modernity”—that science fiction calls into question.  By definition, the new should be a kind of singularity, utterly unexpected and irremediable, an experience that exceeds any known analog:  “the new should have no precedent, should break with the everyday, and thus should be difficult, if not impossible to describe.  If something is new—that is known or made for the first time—then we should, according to Descartes in his influential definition of the new, fall into a passionate state of wonder or surprise.”

Chun astutely calls attention to the way that in technological modernity, the new is constructed in advance of any actual encounter with the supposedly unfamiliar object:  

> Actually using the Internet, for instance, is banal in comparison to its pre-mass usage filmic, televisual, and print representations.  To call X 'new' is to categorize it, to describe and prescribe it, while at the same time to insist that X is wonderful, singular, without opposite or precedent.  This insistence more often than not erases X's previous existence (case in point, the 'discovery' of the 'new world.').

Similarly, Tom Gunning describes the “rhetorical tropes and discursive practices” that have benefitted from the valorization of the new in modernity, with its ever-shorter circuits between astonishment and second nature, amazement and explanation:

> . . . surprise is learned, fostered and expressed by discursive practices whose implementation brings profit to someone: merchants, policy makers, civic fathers justifying municipal power plants, or any one of a number of interested parties.  Modernity must partly be understood as learning to be surprised by certain innovations, a discourse which valorizes and directs our attention to such changes and the excitement they can provoke.

For science fiction to represent the new, then, presents a paradox.  Without a rhetorical framework within which to project and make sense of the new, it would never become legible to us in the first place.  But the way in which science fiction challenges us to imagine the fantastic through things at hand is what provides it with its productive potential for new forms of knowledge about our world.  As Frederic Jameson argues, science fiction’s “deepest vocation is over and over again to demonstrate and to dramatize our incapacity to imagine the future,” radical difference, otherness, or Utopia.

So, in looking at the extraliterary history of everyday estrangement profiled by Chun and Gunning and its constitutive role in the history of science fiction, we will want to ask what is “dramatized” by the historical specificities of the new in the early twentieth century.  What were the “rhetorical tropes and discursive practices” of the new drawn upon by scientifiction, the forms of technological experience the genre sought to represent, and what were the forms of knowledge that such representations produced?  An excavation of early science fiction has implications not only for science fiction studies (which largely ignore this period in the history of the genre), but also for media studies and the question of the scale at which it begins to select its objects of study.  At what point does the study of media transition from a question of technical specificity to one of cultural form:  the electrical impulse, the circuit, the individual device or its content, the delivery infrastructure, or system standards?

This was a formative moment for not only science fiction but media studies itself.  In looking at the ways that amateur experimenter magazines sought to describe and reproduce the estranging effects of new technologies, we will witness the emergence of a critical discourse on media long before it became a topic of academic inquiry.

# Dime Novel Heritage

With most critical histories of science fiction focusing on European precursors such as utopian novels, the fantastic journey, and political satire, the dime novel remains one of the most understudied precursors to science fiction.  This is perhaps also the case for the history of American fiction more broadly, considering Bruce Franklin’s influential argument that the dime novel was the dominant literary form in America between the Civil War and World War I.  

While the various types of fiction published in dime novels was too diverse to constitute a genre in and of itself, the reading habits and mode of production that grew up around the dime novels had just as much of an eventual influence on the early twentieth century science fiction magazines as did their subject matter.  In the astute observation of Bill Brown, the dime novel is

>neither a genre per se (like the novel, the romance, the epic) nor simply a subgenre (like the sentimental novel or the detective novel) but rather a subgenre that is inseparable from its systematic modes of production and distribution.

Take for instance this remarkable history of dime novel production published in a 1904 issue of the New York-based little magazine *The Bookman* provides us with a portrait of this distribution, hinting at the idea that it was no coincidence that the dime novel blossomed in popularity the very year that the Civil War erupted:

>dime novels were sent to the army in the field by cords, like unsaved firewood.  Compact in form, they were easily made up into immense bales, and shipped on any kind of freight car, canal-boat or country wagon. 

Brown argues that the serial narrative form that grew out of these pocket-sized books was a primarily technological phenomenon, an integral component in the mass production of dime novels that couldn’t have taken on any other form.  Writing on dime novel Westerns in particular, he continues, “The technology that produced the Western was completed by the narrative technology of the Western itself—a set of interchangeable parts, a standardized structure, and a regularized rhythm of crisis and resolution, event and explanation.”

I want us to hold on to this idea of a sort of assembly-line arrangement between the “fiction factory” production of dime novels (in which one floor would write the stories, another floor would produce illustrations, another floor would print and bind the stories, and finally another floor would tackle marketing and sales), because later magazines would build upon this foundation with the ideal of how magazine circulation operates…

(SLIDE - MAGAZINE FACTORY)

…as we can see in this image, drawn by Gernsback’s most famous illustrator, Frank R. Paul. 

Paul is one of the most influential artists in the history of science fiction graphic art.  Trained as an architect, Paul is best known for his gaudy cover illustrations of grotesque monsters, streamlined vehicles, and dense urban cityscapes.  But his earlier work in Gernsback’s technical publications has been almost forgotten.

Several times in the early Gernsback publications, Paul illustrated the production of the magazines themselves.  (Here the caption reads, “Old Man H.G. and his performing editorial wildcats turning out the monthly Electrical Experimenter spasm.  …AD LIB)

A regular column Paul provided illustrations for was the tongue-in-cheek “Phoney Patent Offizz,” which always contained a series of satirical “inventions” that have just been filed.  

(SLIDE - PHONEY PATENT OFFIZZ)

In the November 1915 issue of *Electrical Experimenter,* Paul depicts a wearable apparatus for the most dedicated of readers, the “bookworm,” that allows him to read in any number of uncommon situations, including while going for long walks at night.  What’s amazing about this illustration is that the bookworm, outfitted with wearable storage bays, a dynamo, umbrella, fan, and electric watch, is depicted reading from an issue of the Deadwood Dick Library, that veritable laboratory for what would later become solidified as the most popular strands of genre fiction later in the century:  mystery, westerns, fantasy, and science fiction.  

The fact that Paul illustrates the bookworm reading *Deadwood Dick* reveals not only an awareness of the genealogy of science fiction (as early as 1915, twelve years before the launch of *Amazing Stories* where most SF critics locate the birth of the genre) but also an idea of the perfect reading subject for this new form of mass produced literature. The ravenous bookworm is completely incorporated into the larger apparatus of pulp magazine production, reading day and night through “an electro-mechanical” series of wearable selenium cells and induction coils.

Gernsback was aware of the dime novel tradition and explicitly built off it in *Amazing Stories,* republishing edisonades like Serviss’s *A Columbus of Space* in the August through September 1926 issues, and deeming Luis Senarens (author of a majority of the Frank Reade titles) to be “the American Jules Verne” in several editorials on the writer.  

The mythology of Edison as a heroic, autonomous inventor inflected discussions of what Gernsback called “scientifiction” as a genre as much as it did the content of those narratives.  Gernsback attempted to frame the writing of scientifiction stories as a kind of tinkering in itself, “suggesting quite bluntly that the writer of SF was engaged in a kind of quasi-scientific enterprise consisting of thought experiments and possibly leading to discoveries.”

This conceptualization of scientifiction as an educational enterprise that engaged both the writer and reader in a series of thought experiments was an important component of Amazing Stories.  In the now famous editorial introduction to the magazine’s inaugural issue, titled “A New Sort of Magazine,” he writes that scientifiction stories “supply knowledge that we might not otherwise obtain—and they supply it in a very palatable form.  For the best of these modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowledge, and even inspiration, without once making us aware that we are being taught.”

(SLIDE - EE COVERS)

The way in which new technologies and innovations were described in these serial novels and stories was meant not only to amaze but to provide “knowledge” of their significance.  One of the questions I’m interested in here, is what happens to technology when we understand it not through a scientific explanation of how it works, through its technical specificities or engineering makeup, but through a kind of outright wonder in the face of countless new possibilities laid out before us?

(EE COVERS)

In writing on the effect of “wonder,” Tom Gunning argues that “A discourse of wonder draws our attention to new technology, not simply as a tool, but precisely as a spectacle, less as something that performs a useful task than as something which astounds us by performing in a way that seemed unlikely or magical before.”  

In the science magazines, the relationship between wonder and knowledge was brought into question, precisely through new technical objects that challenged conventional modes of understanding.

# Gesture Toward the Present & Digital Gadgetry

Is digital media fundamentally altering the ways we think, read, communicate, write?  This is not a new sentiment, and in the electrical experimenter magazines we see a means of coming to terms with these revelations/revolutions.

We should remember this -- a new kind of technical literacy might be borne out of it.

As Tom Gunning writes, “the cycle from wonder to habit need not run only one way.”
