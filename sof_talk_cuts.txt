(AD-LIB) Many of the Gernsback covers during the War seem to display nothing more than fantasy wish fulfillment -- the idea that we can encase troops in unstoppable steel machines that destroy all enemy targets using radium-powered weapons, or that we could single-handedly end trench warfare by simply rolling along the length of them, dropping bombs with perfect precision using the machine here.

(SAYVILLE COVER)

But for the readers of the Gernsback magazines, these possibilities didnâ€™t seem too far off.  Take for instance the August 1915 issue on the German-owned Sayville, New York wireless telegraph station, which was closed by the U.S. government without comment.  This seemed to be just the latest in a string of government crackdowns on amateur wireless activities, after the Navy had taken control of the airwaves and banned all amateur wireless communications.  It later became clear in the pages of Electrical Experimenter over the next few monthly issues, that a regular reader and contributor to the magazine, Charles Apgar, had devised a means of recording the signals being sent from the station on wax cylinders for the first time -- allowing those messages to be decoded.  They turned out to be relayed from a Nauen station in Germany to U-Boats operated in the Atlantic.  Three months after the sinking of the Lusitania, this was no small feat for an amateur experimenter, and simply seemed to confirm the important role that they were to play in the war.
