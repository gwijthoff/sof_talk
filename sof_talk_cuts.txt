# Gesture Toward the Present & Digital Gadgetry

[Return to the question:  But what future do we imagine ourselves ushering in when we use these devices?  And, what use is the history of fictions about ubiquitous connectivity for the way the actual experience feels?  What we need now in new media studies is a way to account for both these cultural imaginaries that define and precondition our use of new gadgets (the samsung galaxy gear watch ad!) and the new ways in which people are using the devices, the micro-interactions]

Magic, when it is spoken of in relation to technology, usually implies a kind of awe in the face of inscrutable complexity.  According to Arthur C. Clarke's so-called third law, "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."  But it is important for us to remember that there is a very different form of magic that has *everything* to do with legibility.  Gadgets like the ones profiled in the electrical experimenter magazines compel speculation on the patterns of change that they imply, the new forms of lived experience that result from being able to receive a constantly updated news feed on the go or actually see what a friend is doing on the other side of the globe.

And I want to leave us here with a kind of open question, or provocation.

…which, unfortunately I have to leave here as a gesture more than anything else

Are digital media fundamentally altering the ways we think, read, communicate, write?  This is not a new sentiment, and in the electrical experimenter magazines we see a means of coming to terms with these revelations/revolutions.

I wanted to leave this up as my final image to close with, but I figured that replaying the gif might get a little obnoxious, if not creepy.

This was a formative moment for not only science fiction but media studies itself.  These amateur experimenter magazines sought to describe and reproduce the estranging effects of new technologies, in effect giving rise to a critical discourse on media long before it became a topic of academic inquiry.

An excavation of early science fiction has implications not only for science fiction studies (which largely ignore this period in the history of the genre), but also for media studies and the question of the scale at which it begins to select its objects of study.  At what point does the study of media transition from a question of technical specificity to one of cultural form:  the electrical impulse, the circuit, the individual device or its content, the delivery infrastructure, or system standards?

While media studies has classically been interested in large scale materiality -- broadcast networks, representational frameworks, content delivery systems, power structures, transnational flows -- the emergent approaches summarized above indicate a renewed attention to materiality as a process, negotiated on the smallest of scales.[47]  The ongoing debate in paleoarchaeology over how to interpret technical artifacts remains instructive for theorists of media.  What is the unit of analysis we are are interested in:  the technical artifact or the ideational unit that it symbolizes?  The inner structure of that artifact or the web of practices, actors, and materials that it draws together?  Hewing closely to the contours of the gadget as an object of study, I want to ask: what would a media theory of interaction look like, one in which materiality encompassed the mediation between an individual subject and object, user and tool?[48]  What can we read off the shape of the individual artifact:  a distinct culture, unique in space and time, or the uses to which that tool can be put, with all that such usage entails?  While thus far media archaeology seems to privilege the history of vast social and technical apparatuses, a paleoarchaeology of media does not focus exclusively on the artifacts constituting these epistemes but on their techniques as well.  These techniques include not only the technical work process to which a given tool is put, but the ideas behind technologies -- fictions or memes of their efficacy, a subjunctive realm that for Leroi-Gourhan has every bit as much to do with operational sequences as do the tools themselves.  Throughout this project, I will demonstrate how fictions -- broadly understood -- play a constitutive role in the emergence of new media as socially shared systems of communication and expression.

Revisit "interaction," technique/technology, etc.

This is not merely of historical interest, precisely because we need to revisit the humanistic dimensions, the *techniques* that are rightly the province of the humanities.

And yet on another level, there is something to the idea that an encounter with a new technology causes an immediate reorientation in the ways we make sense of the world.  The technophiles of today frequently remark that touching the latest Apple product is like "holding the future in your hands,"

![](images/2001monolith.jpg)

as if the iPhone were the next iteration of the *2001: A Space Odyssey* monolith: a sleek black box whose inner workings we couldn't possibly understand but at the same time, somehow, makes us smarter the instant we touch it.  In this mythical explanation of human origins that falls into the gap of Kubrick's famous match cut from the bone club thrown into the air to the spaceship gracefully floating through outer space, we are simply remade by the tool the moment what might be done with it becomes clear.

This is exciting to me precisely because media studies, a field whose domain is supposed to be the intersections of technology and cultural form, has proven pretty clumsy when it comes to articulating a relationship between these two elements that isn't entirely deterministic:  Poetry *reacts* to the new experiences of speed in technological modernity rather than producing new experiences in its own right; game designers build levels based on the affordances and limitations of the platforms they're designing for, rather than pushing engineers to rethink those platforms and interfaces.

Between the technology and the technique, there is a unique "syntax" negotiated by each of us, drawing upon the capacity to read the range of practical use off the shape of a tool, to imagine a series of possible or desirable outcomes, and to make those intangibles material.

But if we continue in this vein, following Heidegger's insight that "the essence of technology is by no means anything technological," what then should constitute our object of study?  Does a handaxe crafted from a previously prepared stone core constitute a technology or a technique?  What about a telegraph key designed to be grasped in the palm, its sounder struck with the thumb?  Or a touchscreen that allows a pinching gesture to be translated into a change in the size of a digital image?

The relationship between a tool and its affordances has been tackled from a number of angles, and several of these approaches will be drawn upon in what follows.  But very few studies have been willing to take up the imaginary or speculative dimensions necessary to any instance of technical interaction.  Everyone picks up a tool in the subjunctive mood:  what does this make possible that wasn't before?  How hard do I have to swing it?  How can I apply this to my concerns?  Even, why doesn't it work?

As I hope it will become clear, a fuller understanding of these imaginative dimensions is important not only for the everyday tools we have at hand, but for historical and future technologies as well.  Prehistoric stone tools, dead media, and shiny new devices feel like magic because they exceed the contextual frameworks within which we would normally use them while at the same time providing a material trace of what the contours of that use might look like.  In this way, technical literacy evokes specters of the past and the future.  In order to track down the poetics of imagining and imaginary solutions, I would like to proceed inductively, taking my cue from the evolution of a particularly appropriate genre of technology: the gadget.

One argument at the core of science and technology studies is that every technology is in fact a social construction that reflects the political, cultural, and economic environments from which it emerged.  Anne Balsamo, writing on the importance of a humanities approach to the design of new technologies, argues that...

> Humanists (like us!) extend this analysis (of technology's social construction) by noting that every technology also involves the expression of cultural understandings in the form of narratives, myths, values, and truth claims. ^[@balsamo2011]

I would like to argue that on the contrary, humanists need not limit themselves to an analysis of the attendant cultural "expressions" of a technological innovation, as if these expressions could ever be merely second-order representations, untouched by the incursion of the technology itself.  The fictional imagination provides a constitutive dimension of the emergence of any given technology in the first place, down to the smallest wire or transistor.

============

apologize for the fact that I can't stay quite as long as we've been used to during these wonderful lunchtime discussions, since soon after this I have to switch gears pretty radically and teach the Book of Genesis… but I'll try to keep my presentation as brief as appropriate so that we can have enough time for discussion.

The Telephot of course wasn’t technically feasible in 1909, nor was it in 1918 when *Electrical Experimenter* ran a cover story on the device, and indeed both issues discuss bottlenecks such as the weight and thickness of any display capable of showing these images.

==== cut here, paraphrase the rest?

Gernsback was aware of the dime novel tradition and explicitly built off it in *Amazing Stories,* republishing edisonades like Serviss’s *A Columbus of Space* in the August through September 1926 issues, and deeming Luis Senarens (author of a majority of the Frank Reade titles) to be “the American Jules Verne” in several editorials on the writer.  

The mythology of Edison as a heroic, autonomous inventor inflected discussions of what Gernsback called “scientifiction” as a genre as much as it did the content of those narratives.  

(AD-LIB) Many of the Gernsback covers during the War seem to display nothing more than fantasy wish fulfillment -- the idea that we can encase troops in unstoppable steel machines that destroy all enemy targets using radium-powered weapons, or that we could single-handedly end trench warfare by simply rolling along the length of them, dropping bombs with perfect precision using the machine here.

(SAYVILLE COVER)

But for the readers of the Gernsback magazines, these possibilities didn’t seem too far off.  Take for instance the August 1915 issue on the German-owned Sayville, New York wireless telegraph station, which was closed by the U.S. government without comment.  This seemed to be just the latest in a string of government crackdowns on amateur wireless activities, after the Navy had taken control of the airwaves and banned all amateur wireless communications.  It later became clear in the pages of Electrical Experimenter over the next few monthly issues, that a regular reader and contributor to the magazine, Charles Apgar, had devised a means of recording the signals being sent from the station on wax cylinders for the first time -- allowing those messages to be decoded.  They turned out to be relayed from a Nauen station in Germany to U-Boats operated in the Atlantic.  Three months after the sinking of the Lusitania, this was no small feat for an amateur experimenter, and simply seemed to confirm the important role that they were to play in the war.

In many ways, by putting forward an extra-literary model of science fiction as a kind of experience that arises in the everyday, recent critics are returning to the intellectual core of Suvin’s theory even as they seek to revise it.  The genealogy of Suvin’s concept of “estrangement” lies precisely in such an attempt to account for everyday experience, drawing heavily upon Russian formalist literary critic Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of *ostranenie,* translated most commonly as “defamiliarization.”

For Shklovsky, all art possesses the ability to militate against the habituation of perception, the process by which the monotony of our daily experience causes objects to “retreat into the area of the unconsciously automatic.”  Picking up a hammer for the first time is a completely different experience when one compares it to holding that tool for the ten thousandth time.  Much like Heidegger’s account of the way in which the tool disappears into a work process, some form of exteriorization or distance from that tool is required to understand its essence in any way.

For Heidegger, this occurs when the tool breaks.  But for Shklovsky, it is art that exists to “make the stone stony,” as he puts it.

> The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,’ to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.  Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object: the object is not important.

The end goal of Shklovsky’s reorientation toward objects that have retreated into the invisibility of habit is not to achieve a new kind of knowledge about the object.  For Shklovsky, perception is a process wholly different from knowledge (thus forcing Suvin to modify the Russian formalist account so that it might be used as a descriptor of science fiction, which involves a “cognitive,” or empirical, form of estrangement).  Shklovsky writes, “Defamiliarization is found almost anywhere form is found. […] Its purpose is not to make us perceive meaning, but to create a special perception of the object—it creates a vision of the object instead of serving as a means for knowing it.”  Suvin on the other hand places an emphasis on estrangement as the confrontation of “a set normative system—a Ptolemaic-type closed world picture—with a point of view or glance implying a new set of norms.”  But this confrontation need not be the sole province of literary fiction, with its systematic construction of fictional worlds through narrative means.  Estrangement is simply the process by which any form of aesthetic representation allows us to hold an everyday object at arm’s length, to make it strangely new once again. 

Shklovsky’s ostranenie highlights the aesthetics of what Bernard Stiegler calls “technics and time”:  the temporal frameworks into which we place our tools and the uses to which they have been, are being, and can be put.  Out of this core scene—an object that is made strange to us—an incredible number of literary aesthetics, media theories, and design objectives have been inspired, each of which proceeds from a slightly different temporal framework.

* * * * * *

In some, the newly gained perspective proceeds from some quality of the tool itself (it is broken; it is a fantastic innovation), while in others it is a product of a representation or narrative of that tool.  Such an aesthetic distanciation might proceed from a lengthy process of extended attention, perception, and appreciation, as it does for Shklovsky.  It may also be the product of a spectacular shock or momentary tableau, the latter best exemplified by the Gestus and “alienation effect” of Bertolt Brecht’s epic theater.  The temporal condition of the tool itself is also in question:  the tool might be a well-worn mainstay of the craftsman, marked by the unique imprints of use; it might be a brand new device that promises to change our lives while at the same time exceeding our ability to understand how it works; or it might be an imaginary gadget from the future whose functionality somehow manages to remain legible to us in our newly appreciated historicity.

But John Onians writes of both “the physical and mental immobility” produced by wonder, clarifying that “To ‘wonder’ is merely to ask oneself a trivial question, but to feel ‘wonder’ is to acknowledge the impact of an extraordinary sensory experience.  Wonder and questioning are certainly closely connected.”

* * * * * *

One interesting phenomenon in this regard is the way in which the new is constructed in advance of any actual encounter with any supposedly unfamiliar object in technological modernity.  Wendy Chun writes that

> Actually using the Internet, for instance, is banal in comparison to its pre-mass usage filmic, televisual, and print representations.  To call X 'new' is to categorize it, to describe and prescribe it, while at the same time to insist that X is wonderful, singular, without opposite or precedent.  This insistence more often than not erases X's previous existence (case in point, the 'discovery' of the 'new world.').

* * * * * *

Wendy Chun, writing on the new as itself “a historical category linked to the rise of modernity” points out that by definition, the new should be a kind of singularity, utterly unexpected and irremediable, an experience that exceeds any known analog.

> the new should have no precedent, should break with the everyday, and thus should be difficult, if not impossible to describe.  If something is new -- that is known or made for the first time -- then we should, according to Descartes in his influential definition of the new, fall into a passionate state of wonder or surprise.”

For science fiction to represent the new, then, presents a paradox.  Without a rhetorical framework within which to project and make sense of the new, it would never become legible to us in the first place.

But the way in which science fiction challenges us to imagine the fantastic through things at hand is what provides it with its productive potential for new forms of knowledge about our world.  As Frederic Jameson argues, science fiction’s “deepest vocation is over and over again to demonstrate and to dramatize our incapacity to imagine the future,” radical difference, otherness, or Utopia.

So the title of this book project is *Gadgetry: New Media and the Fictional Imagination,* and it is a cultural history of the gadget as a particular *genre* of technology.  Gadgets include both actual tools you can hold in your hand and perform certain actions with (we can look around this room right now, or root through our pockets, and come up with some devices we would call gadgets), but they include fictional devices as well: the word can serve as a kind of placeholder for a tool that hasn't been invented yet, or is entirely fantastic.  The gadget is an object that lives a curiously double life as both a functional and fictional device.

What makes the gadget an important and understudied topic in the cultural history of media technologies is the fact that its fundamental instrumentality changes from decade to decade.  Though the word "gadget" is a sort of empty container for any object whatsoever, the shape of that container changes drastically from its origins in late nineteenth century nautical jargon to its present day association with mobile media.  The functionality of the gadget is redefined for the material needs and fictional desires of each new era.
