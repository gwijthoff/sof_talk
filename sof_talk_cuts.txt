(AD-LIB) Many of the Gernsback covers during the War seem to display nothing more than fantasy wish fulfillment -- the idea that we can encase troops in unstoppable steel machines that destroy all enemy targets using radium-powered weapons, or that we could single-handedly end trench warfare by simply rolling along the length of them, dropping bombs with perfect precision using the machine here.

(SAYVILLE COVER)

But for the readers of the Gernsback magazines, these possibilities didn’t seem too far off.  Take for instance the August 1915 issue on the German-owned Sayville, New York wireless telegraph station, which was closed by the U.S. government without comment.  This seemed to be just the latest in a string of government crackdowns on amateur wireless activities, after the Navy had taken control of the airwaves and banned all amateur wireless communications.  It later became clear in the pages of Electrical Experimenter over the next few monthly issues, that a regular reader and contributor to the magazine, Charles Apgar, had devised a means of recording the signals being sent from the station on wax cylinders for the first time -- allowing those messages to be decoded.  They turned out to be relayed from a Nauen station in Germany to U-Boats operated in the Atlantic.  Three months after the sinking of the Lusitania, this was no small feat for an amateur experimenter, and simply seemed to confirm the important role that they were to play in the war.

In many ways, by putting forward an extra-literary model of science fiction as a kind of experience that arises in the everyday, recent critics are returning to the intellectual core of Suvin’s theory even as they seek to revise it.  The genealogy of Suvin’s concept of “estrangement” lies precisely in such an attempt to account for everyday experience, drawing heavily upon Russian formalist literary critic Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of *ostranenie,* translated most commonly as “defamiliarization.”

For Shklovsky, all art possesses the ability to militate against the habituation of perception, the process by which the monotony of our daily experience causes objects to “retreat into the area of the unconsciously automatic.”  Picking up a hammer for the first time is a completely different experience when one compares it to holding that tool for the ten thousandth time.  Much like Heidegger’s account of the way in which the tool disappears into a work process, some form of exteriorization or distance from that tool is required to understand its essence in any way.

For Heidegger, this occurs when the tool breaks.  But for Shklovsky, it is art that exists to “make the stone stony,” as he puts it.

> The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,’ to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.  Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object: the object is not important.

The end goal of Shklovsky’s reorientation toward objects that have retreated into the invisibility of habit is not to achieve a new kind of knowledge about the object.  For Shklovsky, perception is a process wholly different from knowledge (thus forcing Suvin to modify the Russian formalist account so that it might be used as a descriptor of science fiction, which involves a “cognitive,” or empirical, form of estrangement).  Shklovsky writes, “Defamiliarization is found almost anywhere form is found. […] Its purpose is not to make us perceive meaning, but to create a special perception of the object—it creates a vision of the object instead of serving as a means for knowing it.”  Suvin on the other hand places an emphasis on estrangement as the confrontation of “a set normative system—a Ptolemaic-type closed world picture—with a point of view or glance implying a new set of norms.”  But this confrontation need not be the sole province of literary fiction, with its systematic construction of fictional worlds through narrative means.  Estrangement is simply the process by which any form of aesthetic representation allows us to hold an everyday object at arm’s length, to make it strangely new once again. 

Shklovsky’s ostranenie highlights the aesthetics of what Bernard Stiegler calls “technics and time”:  the temporal frameworks into which we place our tools and the uses to which they have been, are being, and can be put.  Out of this core scene—an object that is made strange to us—an incredible number of literary aesthetics, media theories, and design objectives have been inspired, each of which proceeds from a slightly different temporal framework.

In some, the newly gained perspective proceeds from some quality of the tool itself (it is broken; it is a fantastic innovation), while in others it is a product of a representation or narrative of that tool.  Such an aesthetic distanciation might proceed from a lengthy process of extended attention, perception, and appreciation, as it does for Shklovsky.  It may also be the product of a spectacular shock or momentary tableau, the latter best exemplified by the Gestus and “alienation effect” of Bertolt Brecht’s epic theater.  The temporal condition of the tool itself is also in question:  the tool might be a well-worn mainstay of the craftsman, marked by the unique imprints of use; it might be a brand new device that promises to change our lives while at the same time exceeding our ability to understand how it works; or it might be an imaginary gadget from the future whose functionality somehow manages to remain legible to us in our newly appreciated historicity.

But John Onians writes of both “the physical and mental immobility” produced by wonder, clarifying that “To ‘wonder’ is merely to ask oneself a trivial question, but to feel ‘wonder’ is to acknowledge the impact of an extraordinary sensory experience.  Wonder and questioning are certainly closely connected.”
